            "My second project was Governance and Operations Tool UI-UX development. Here in this project, I was assigned a task to create a modern-looking UI and add more functionalities to the tool using HTML, CSS, and JS. This tool aims to track the things performed by every member working on their respective projects or ventures. It contains two different bifurcations for Analysts and Managers. The manager section contains various features like Create New Task, View Assigned Task, User-wise Dashboard Section, Issue Tracker Section, View Leakage Dashboard, and User Access Management Section. The analyst section contains features like Create New Task, View Assigned Task, Manage SLA Compliance, Report/Update an Issue, View Status of Issue, Track Initiative Progress, Monthly Self-Assessment, Issue Tracker, etc. The sole purpose of creating this tool was to create one place where every project's progress can be tracked properly.",

            "My third project was Audit-Automation Tool in which I have given contributions in both frontend and at the backend. Here the purpose of this project was not to automate the entire process of the audit report generation but to remove all the redundant work which we do while creating the audit report. So instead of wasting a lot of time in creating the basic ppt, we would automate this process where after filling the forms having all the required fields we would get that same generated ppt were just by selecting certain input fields and dropdowns regarding the problem and their required controls used for creating the audit report would generate a ppt having that KPMG Template(having sock reports embedded into it) + basic options that we had chosen earlier to provide it to the client as our final report. The tool contains 2 portals – for admin i.e., Manager and Above Manager Level, and for Below Manager Level. In the case of admin, we would have functionalities like Creating an audit report, Seeing the List of Audits, exporting Documents, etc. In the case of Below Manager Level, we would have the functionalities of Seeing the List of Audit, Export Documents, and Alignment of RACM to the Audit, and even we would have timely email reminders but would not have the functionality of Creating an audit report as that feature is only given to Manager or Above Manager.",
